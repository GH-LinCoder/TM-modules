htmlStubs

incomplete pages. They only have <divs>. There are no <!doc type> or <head> or <body>

These are for insertion into the DOM.

Some are treated as 'pages' by flexmain.js which loads them into panels in the scaffold of the webpage.

Some are used as templates such as statCard which represents a standard display card struture. (Also see the statCard.js which can dynamically produce these cards.)
