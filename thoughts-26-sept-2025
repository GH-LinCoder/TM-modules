Two App dev tasks

1) App DEV code infrastructure
(list items already done)
create initial db tables for tasks/steps/ assignments
mock-up adminDash & memberDash
added display of quick stats from db
add create task
add asign task
changed tech from lovable /vite/ react to plain serve javascript
Adapted page display from The Lab
created dynamic display using html stub pages and forms
changed to state machine & listeners to load pages
changed from html stubs, converted to js modules
added db event logging
added db triggers and functions on create task
developed idea of 'approfiles'
added registry
added petition for change of state
added breadcrumb tracking of petitions
added how? using breadcrumb to know context for instructions
developed create task module
developed assign task module
developed move student module

future: actual sign-in
future: sessions
future: paginated list display
future: edit forms
future: display anything
future: move towards subcontract of member fee management




2) App DEV work superstructure
(list approfiles & tasks and relationships to create)
Create high level approfiles:
App (the entire web app)  [App IS member of Org]
Org (the organisation)
Test Mock (all the things that are for dev test rather than real) [Test Mock IS member OF App]
Database
Software
Supabase
GitHub
Codespaces
Qwen
Copilot
Gemini
Human (for all auth users)  [Human IS member of Org]
Categories (for any approfile that is itself a category that others belong to)

create the task steps that are needed to teach the app

Check that every approfile is related to something and is part of hierarchy.  

(Need a 'no one is an island' utility to find unmapped approfiles: forEach appro in the app_profiles TABLE search by id in the app_relations table. islandArry.Push[row] || relatedArray.push[row] 
Then can output the islands or the connected.)

Create the survey module. Should we have an editable survey creator? This would have click options to task assignment or/& to approfile relation



[Try to avoid using approfiles for things that change like 'newbies' ]
