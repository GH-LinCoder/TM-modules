  <p>We have three categories called <i>Persons</i>, <i>Tracking</i>, and <i>Bridging.</i></p>
  <p>'Persons' have as their core data structure the 'approfile' (app profile). 'Tracking' has as its core data structure 'tasks' and the linked sub-structure 'steps'. Bridging has as its core data structure 'task_assignments'.</p>
  <p>So on one side we have persons, on the other side we have tracking and what links them is bridging.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Persons are represented by approfiles. When a person gets bridged to tracking they are linked. As an example an 'approfile' is linked via 'task_assignments' to a 'task'.</p>

  <h2>From abstract thoughts to abstract approfiles</h2>
  <p>This is where it gets weird. Persons are represented by approfiles, but groups can also be represented by approfiles. When a group gets bridged to tracking they are linked in the same way as a person. As an example an 'approfile' for a group can also be linked via 'task_assignments' to a 'task'.</p>
<p> A group is an example of an abstract profile, no longer limited to representing a human being or even a group of humans. An abstract approfile can represent a webpage or an essay or a youTube channel.
</p>
<p>Any abstract approfile, whether a group or a webpage, like any human represented by an approfile, can be assigned to a task.</p>
<p>It is weird to be able to assign a webpage to a task, it is even weirder that we then refer to the webpage as the 'student', but bear with it.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>In the process of assignment we bring into existence a category 'student' we may also bring into existence the category 'manager'. These may be fleeting categories. It is easy to understand the category of 'student' if the task is a training course.
  The person being trained is the student, and the person responsible for grading the student is the manager.</p>
  <p>But the system allows an abstract idea, such as a planned party or an, as yet, unwritten essay, to be assigned to a task, and we continue to use the term 'student' for the approfile representing the abstract idea.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that a 'task' can be a training course, or it can be a record of an external training course, but it can also be step by step instructions on how to create a webpage or a system to track the progress of some entirely external process.</p>
  <p>Inside 'tracking' we have two closely related data types 'tasks' and 'steps'. Steps are a sub category of tasks. Steps cannot exist alone. Tasks always have at least 3 steps.</p>

  <h2>From abstract thoughts to relationships between abstract thoughts</h2>

  <p>In addition to being able to place any approfile on a task, approfiles can also be related to each other</p>
  <p>Relations or relationships are a powerful tool in building hierarchy and management. Any approfile can be related to any other approfile</p>

        <div class="meta-label-small">Read the relationship and then 'of' this second approfile </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>Any approfile can be assigned or related</h2>
<p>An approfile can be related to any other approfile via the relationship system, the approfile can also be assigned to a task via the assignments system.
</p><p>Tasks all have approfiles and so tasks can also be related to other tasks or to humans or to groups. Relating a task to a person is different to assigning that person to the task.</p>
<p>Tasks can be related, via the relationship system to other tasks. In this way tasks can be grouped or mutually exclusive or successors/predecesors of othe tasks.</p>
<p>Relating a task to an abstract approfile such as a group or a webpage, allows the user to quickly find all tasks related to a particular project.</p>
<p>The approfile relation system also makes it easy to find all the humans involved in a group of human or in a group of tasks.</p>
<p>The approfile relationship system is a powerful tool in building the organisation and in organising.</p>
