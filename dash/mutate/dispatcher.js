/*
dashboardMutationRegistry[section] tries to access the object for the given section (e.g. 'task-&-member').

The ?. is the optional chaining operator â€” it checks if the left-hand side exists before trying to access the next level.

[action] then tries to access the mutation config for that specific action (e.g. 'member-management').

What the registry returns is the part of the object following  section.action {  which is the title for the section and the definitions of the cards}
