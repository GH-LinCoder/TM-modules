<p>
Let me describe several different possible uses:  <br>
1) A self-contained training course where all the relevant data is in the step descriptions.<br>
2) A tracking device for progress on an external training course where the steps give a brief description of what the step will comprise. <br>
3) A list of instructions 'do this', now do this...'<br>
4) A soft production line in which the approfile that represents say a webpage is moved through steps (in this case the only person involved is the manager. The abstract approfile is the 'student')<br> 
5) An internal task that has a student on it, but the student is unaware of this, such as an internal process of checking qualifications or results of a questionnaire.<br>
6) A self managed task where the student can move through the task (using moveStudent)<br>
7) A task managed where only the manager can move the student to the next step.<br>
8) A task where all the steps are available for view at any time by a student<br>
9) A task where the student is not allowed to see later steps (perhaps they contain answers to questions that are asked in earlier steps)...
