The 'notes' system is a fork of "The Lab" by KekiSurveyor. It only containd the notes and tagging system and does not include the other pages of the original.

T&M plan to expand it as the basis of internal messaging.

The tags are also expected to be the basis of filtering of the displayed notes

It will be adapted to use the executeIfPermitted function instead of the direct db access of the original.

T&M have permission for this use.
